# tjuthesis
Latex  templates for TJU thesis. Modified according to the format requirements of the 2016 Tianjin University Master's Thesis. This is more suitable for academic master.

(1) Modify files tjumain.tex and package.tex to change the compile way as pdflatex

(2) The original template is for engineering master, and the cover includes ccorsupervisor, but it's not suitable for academic master, so I annotate the ccorsupervisor in the format.tex

(3) Using the command environment \makeletter and \makeatother, I redefine some Algorithm command for the Chinese environment
